# Customizable Shell in Python 🐍

A lightweight, extensible, and fully customizable shell environment built entirely in Python. This project provides a terminal-like interface with support for built-in commands, external program execution, and user-defined configurations.

## ✨ Features
* **Built-in Commands**: Essential operations like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, and `exit`.
* **External Execution**: Run system binaries and scripts found in your `PATH`.
* **Customization**: Supports configuration via an RC file (e.g., `.pyzrc`) for custom prompts and themes.
* **Command History**: Easily navigate through previous commands using the `readline` module.
* **Error Handling**: Graceful feedback for invalid commands or directory issues.
